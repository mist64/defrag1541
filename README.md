# defrag1541

`defrag1541` is a visual Commodore 64/1541 disk defragmentation program written in BASIC.

It is currently only useful for its visualization and will create disks that are actually slower than before. Don't use it on real data!

* defrag1541.bas is the lowercase ASCII version of the program
* defrag1541.prg is the tokenized executable
